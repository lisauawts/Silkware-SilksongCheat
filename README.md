# Silkware-SilksongCheat
A Hollow Knight Silksong Cheat Menu


ANY PROBLEMS YOU RUN INTO ARE DUE TO MEMORY ADDRESS AND OFFSETS BEING INCORRECT. 
I WILL BE LOOKING INTO A FIX BUT IT WONT BE FOR A LITTLE WHILE. 
IF YOU WANT A WORKING CHEAT JUST FIND THE POINTERS FROM YOUR PC USING CHEAT ENGINE AND PLUG THEM INTO THE SCRIPT.
I WILL NOT BE EXPLAINING HOW TO DO THAT THERE ARE PLENTY OF YOUTUBE VIDEOS.

 Pressing period closes and open the window.
 To move the window press down on the silkware label or the dark gray around it and drag the window where you want it.
 
I recommend downloading the latest release from the release tab. 
It is the Silkware.exe it avoids any issues with needing specific python libraries.

- "Silkware V4" on the right under the "Releases" tab
- launch the game and charge the save
- alt+tab, launch the silkware.exe, check the box, then let the panel open and alt-tab back to the game (i closed it the first time and the godmod was working, but it stoped briefly after ; no problem by keeping the panel on the bottom of my sceen)
